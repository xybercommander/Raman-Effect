Dr. CV Raman is one of only six Indians to have won the Nobel prize till date. Dr. Raman won the Nobel Prize in Physics in the year 1928 for discovering the Raman effect. He was also later awarded the Bharat Ratna in the year 1954.
 
Dr. Raman once while on a voyage to Europe, looked at the sea and wondered why it is blue. He subsequently conducted experiments on water and transparent blocks of ice and discovered the reason to be scattering of light. He passed a ray of monochromatic light from a mercury arc through a transparent substance and on observing the spectrum of light so obtained, noticed that some wavelengths of light had changed. He called this phenomenon Raman scattering which occurred due to the Raman effect. This was further proof of the quantum nature of light. 
 
The discovery of the Raman effect was a very important discovery in the field of science and helped put India on the map of the scientific world. The significance of the discovery can be gauged from the fact that each chemical compound has its specific molecular signature of scattering and the Raman effect can be used to identify such new compounds.

The Raman Effect is an app made with love using flutter to help students stay organised & learn with fun. The app consist of task points which will make the user interaction more easier with a ranking system like those in games.

<br>


## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone it :busts_in_silhouette:

You need to clone (download) it to local machine using

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/Raman-Effect.git
```

> This makes a local copy of repository in your machine.

Once you have cloned the the repository in Github, move to that folder first using change directory command on linux and Mac.

```sh
# This will change directory to a folder  Raman-Effect
$ cd Raman-Effect
```

Move to this folder for all other commands.

<br>



### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set it up :arrow_up:

Run the following commands to see that *your local copy* has a reference to *your forked remote repository* in Github :octocat:

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/Raman-Effect.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/Raman-Effect.git (push)
```
Now, lets add a reference to the original [Raman-Effect](https://github.com/xybercommander/Raman-Effect) repository using

```sh
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/xybercommander/Raman-Effect.git
```

> This adds a new remote named ***upstream***.

See the changes using

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/Raman-Effect.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/Raman-Effect.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/xybercommander/Raman-Effect.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/xybercommander/Raman-Effect.git (push)
```

<br>



### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Sync it :recycle:

Always keep your local copy of repository updated with the original repository.
Before making any changes and/or in an appropriate interval, run the following commands *carefully* to update your local repository.

```sh
# Fetch all remote repositories and delete any deleted remote branches
$ git fetch --all --prune

# Switch to `master` branch
$ git checkout master

# Reset local `master` branch to match `upstream` repository's `master` branch
$ git reset --hard upstream/master

# Push changes to your forked `Raman-Effect` repo
$ git push origin master
```

<br>



### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Ready Steady Go... :turtle: :rabbit2:

Once you have completed these steps, you are ready to start contributing by checking our `Help Wanted` Issues and creating

<br>

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Create a new branch :bangbang:

Whenever you are going to make contribution. Please create seperate branch using command and keep your `master` branch clean (i.e. synced with remote branch).

```sh
# It will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and switch to branch Folder_Name
$ git checkout -b Folder_Name
```

Create a seperate branch for contibution and try to use same name of branch as of folder.

To switch to desired branch

```sh
# To switch from one folder to other
$ git checkout Folder_Name
```

To add the changes to the branch. Use

```sh
# To add all files to branch Folder_Name
$ git add .
```

Type in a message relevant for the code reveiwer using

```sh
# This message get associated with all files you have changed
$ git commit -m 'relevant message'
```

<br>


### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Share your work :star_struck:

Now, Push your awesome work to your remote repository using

```sh
# To push your work to your remote repository
$ git push -u origin Folder_Name
```

Then, go to your repository in browser and click on `compare and pull requests`.
Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your precious effort.
